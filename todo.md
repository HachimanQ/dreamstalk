HUGE PROBLEM: In comiteePage, eventPage: ROW-FEATURETTE PART IS NOT RESPONSIVE

IN CONTACTS PAGE, THE PHONE AND EMAIL SECTION GETS MESSED UP IN MOBILE SCREENS. USE MORE RESPONSIVE DESIGN TO FIX

little problem: organization got too messed up. links to css files are all over the code, links to js files too.
standardize them. fix the file organization too.

improve accessability by replacing some div's with sections.

carousels' css are a bit messed up with distinct rules. 




MINI TO-DOs:





2.5- centralize the second contact section (full name & message etc.)
4- localize the language and remove stuff from templates.
6- remove carousels sliding parts if they are unnecessary



(LATE VERSION!!
 1- AFTER COMPLETING THE CONVERSION TO REACT, CREATE A ADMIN PANEL WHICH THE ADMIN CAN USE TO ADD CONTENT TO THE PAGE)
 2- MAKE NAVLINKS TO BE MORE REACTIVE, THEY SHOULD EXPAND WHEN HOVERED OVER
 * fill the footer with buttons and directions as well.
5- learn the ideal background image pixels for the carousel.
6- complete sponsorts page: it will be similar to https://businessclub.metu.edu.tr/sponsorlar (THIS PART REQUIRES GRID, SO IT WILL BE COMPLETED IN THE SECOND VERSION) 
(USE THIS TO COMPLETE https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/examples/grid/)
2- complete contact page contact page will be similar to https://www.maketistan.com/iletisim (with better background image of course)




***************************
    To-Dos:
1- Prepare the Outline: Copy the constant parts of the website such as footer, header, cover (carousel like). 
   They will remain the same regardless of the content.

2- make a new page that is only the outline. navbar (header), footer, carousel, content box

3- index.html i gereksiz parçaları ayıkla

3- as a prototype for the card sliders, use unslideable cards. make them slideable in the last version. 

4- complete pages 

5- complete the little parts like functional href's, dreamstalk as logo, be able to replace pictures etc.

6- convert the website to react for better performance. it doesn't need to load full pages every time because most of the content
   is same anyway.

7- make the header transparent when the cover is displayed. 

8- for comitee pages, replace the box with title and little paragraphs.






    Pages: 
1- About Us page, combined with the "board of management" section
//////////////////

2- Page for Commitees: Every comitee will have its own page, it won't be complicated 

   What does it do part: This section will direct readers to events of the club where this comitee worked in.
//////////////////

3- Our Activities Part: This will be similar to 'What does it do' part, but it will contain text and a photo for the events.

4- Sponsorts part: This will contain a huge div that has boxes of brands. Every box will be a picture of the brand logo and should be clickable. Once clicked, they will direct to the page of the brand. 

5- Frequently Asked Questions part: Will contain expandable divs when clicked. 

6- Contacts part: Will provide contact info under a cover part. Cover will contain Contact information like mail, phone. basically copy the examples.

(LATE VERSION: there should be Google Maps part that shows the location of Gazi University.)
(Optional: Mail sende. When provided with name, mail info, phone number, you should be able to send email.)
